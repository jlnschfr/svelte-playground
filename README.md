## My first steps in svelte

The following ideas I wanted to verify with this project:

- setup a svelte project and get to know the reactivity system, see `lib/Roombar.svelte`
- setup and use typescript
- setup eslint, stylelint and prettier in the svelte ecosystem

## Out of Scope

- the app is not optimized for mobile devices and won't work responsive

## Run the project

```
git clone git@github.com:jlnschfr/svelte-playground.git
cd svelte-playground
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Linting

```
npm run lint
```
